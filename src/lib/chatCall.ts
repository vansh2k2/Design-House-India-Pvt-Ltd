/* A spoken call with the website chat's assistant (components/ui/Chatbot.tsx), over WebRTC to OpenAI's Realtime voice
   model. The backend opens the call, so no key is in the browser; after that sound goes straight between the browser
   and OpenAI, and events (what was said, what the assistant wants done) come over a data channel.

   Before the mic's sound goes out it passes a gate, so the assistant hears the person at the microphone and not the
   room. Whoever is talking to the chat is the loudest voice at the mic: the gate learns how loud they are and stays
   shut for anything much quieter (a fan, a TV, people further away).

   Noise cancellation (the chat's switch, on by default) adds a neural noise filter in front of the gate (GTCRN, from
   @sapphi-red/web-noise-suppressor; its files are in public/assets/chatbot/noise), and a stricter gate. If the filter
   can't load, the call goes on without it. */
